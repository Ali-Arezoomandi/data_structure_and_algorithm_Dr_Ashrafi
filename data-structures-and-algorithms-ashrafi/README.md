# Data Structures and Algorithms – Ashrafi Book Solutions

This repository contains solutions to exercises from **"Data Structures and Algorithms"** by **Dr. Ashrafi**, implemented in both **Java** and **Python**.  
The goal of this project is to understand core data structure concepts, algorithmic problem-solving, and computational complexity through clean, well-documented code.

## 🧠 About the Book

The book by **Dr. Ashrafi** is widely used in Iranian universities for teaching **Data Structures and Algorithms**.  
It covers key theoretical foundations and practical exercises involving:
- Algorithm analysis and complexity
- Arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues
- Trees, graphs, and recursion
- Sorting and searching algorithms

This repository includes **my personal solutions** to the exercises, organized by chapter and implemented in two languages for better understanding and comparison.
